# Third-Machine-Learning-Program

I have used MNIST dataset which is a large collection of handwritten digits. It is a very popular dataset in the field of image processing. It is often used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

MNIST is short for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database.

MNIST contains a collection of 70,000, 28 x 28 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The dataset is already divided into training and testing sets.


# KERAS AND TENSORFLOW

# Keras
Its a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation and providing a delightful developer experience.

The purpose of Keras is to give an unfair advantage to any developer looking to ship ML-powered apps.

Keras is:

Simple -- but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter. Keras focuses on ease of use, debugging speed, code elegance & conciseness, maintainability, and deployability (via TFServing, TFLite, TF.js).

Flexible -- Keras adopts the principle of progressive disclosure of complexity: simple workflows should be quick and easy, while arbitrarily advanced workflows should be possible via a clear path that builds upon what you've already learned.

Powerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, and Waymo. That's right -- your YouTube recommendations are powered by Keras, and so is the world's most advanced driverless vehicle.

# TensorFlow 
Its an end-to-end, open-source machine learning platform. You can think of it as an infrastructure layer for differentiable programming. It combines four key abilities:

Efficiently executing low-level tensor operations on CPU, GPU, or TPU.

Computing the gradient of arbitrary differentiable expressions.

Scaling computation to many devices, such as clusters of hundreds of GPUs.

Exporting programs ("graphs") to external runtimes such as servers, browsers, mobile and embedded devices.

Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. It provides essential abstractions and building blocks for developing and shipping machine learning solutions with high iteration velocity.

Keras empowers engineers and researchers to take full advantage of the scalability and cross-platform capabilities of TensorFlow 2: you can run Keras on TPU or on large clusters of GPUs, and you can export your Keras models to run in the browser or on a mobile device.
